# Cell Society
Duke CompSci 308 Cell Society Project

**Names:** Blake Kaplan, Austin Wu, Amy Zhao

**Date Started:** 1/30/16

**Date Finished:** 2/6/16

**Team Roles:**

* Blake Kaplan - XML Generation and Parsing
* Austin Wu - User Interface and Graphics
* Amy Zhao - Game Rules and Functionality

**Resources Used:**

* StackOverflow for miscellaneous questions and errors
* Oracle Java documentation for general information
* Tutorials Point for help with DOM XML Generation and Parsing

**Starting the Project:**

To start the simulation, run Main.java, load a file in the GUI, and press start or step through with the step button.

To generate a new XML file, open XMLGenerator.java, set the arguments in the `generateFile(int rows, int cols, String gameName, List<String> parameters, List<String> states, String filename)` function as desired.

**Testing the Project:**

We have included pregenerated test files in our data folder

* Game of Life
  * glider.xml
  * oscilators.xml
  * GameOfLife1.xml
  * GameOfLife2.xml
  * GameOfLife3.xml

* Fire
  * Fire1.xml
  * Fire2.xml
  * Fire3.xml

* Predator Prey
  * fish.xml
  * shark.xml
  * sharkEatsFish.xml
  * sharkEatsFishThatAlreadyMoved.xml
  * PredatorPrey1.xml
  * PredatorPrey2.xml
  * PredatorPrey3.xml

* Segregation
  * Segregation1.xml
  * Segregation2.xml
  * Segregation3.xml

**Resource Files Required:** None

**Interesting Information:** None

**Known Bugs:** None

**Extra Features:** As described above, we have included an XML file generator that randomly generates XML simulation setup files. These files can be loaded from the data folder using the simulation GUI.

**Impressions:** So far, we have found the project to be very manageable. We got started early and got our functionality working fairly quickly. We have worked well together as a group.
