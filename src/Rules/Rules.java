// This entire file is part of my masterpiece.
// Amy Zhao (abz3)

// For my code masterpiece, I refactored my abstract base class for my Rules inheritance hierarchy. The purpose of this
// code is to provide a base from which rules specific to each simulation can be added. Thus, it is designed to be open 
// to extension by adding subclasses for specific cell automata simulations, while being closed to what class of
// simulations it may be used for (i.e. only for implementing rules for cell automata simulations). 

// By adding subclasses, we allow for extension by the addition of more complicated rules or the use of given methods 
// for new applications (e.g. the countSurroundingNeighborsOfType() method is used for counting the number of neighbors
// of the same type and the total number of neighbors in the Segregation simulation, and for counting the number of 
// live neighbors in the Game of Life simulation). Using deductive commonality analysis, I was able to identify other 
// important methods in addition to the countSurroundingNeighborsOfType() method that are used in many different CA 
// simulations, such as generateRandom() for picking a random index for a list (e.g. picking a random water cell 
// for a fish to move to in the Predator Prey simulation, as well as generating random amounts of initial sugar for 
// agents in the Sugarscape simulations), generateRandomWithinLimits() for picking random numbers between bounds such 
// as age limits, switchCells() for switching the states and locations of two cells, and isLastCellInGrid(), which is
// used by many simulations for identifying when to apply a certain change to all of the cells at that must be applied 
// only at the end of a step (e.g. resetting all flags for ants that have moved in a given turn for the ForagingAnts 
// simulation, and moving the cells that can and want to be moved in the Segregation simulation). This allowed for 
// elimination of duplicate code in many of the subclasses.

// The methods written for this class also make it closed for use by cell automata simulations only because they
// are specific to updating a simulation that handles a grid with cells whose states change based on their relative
// location within the grid and their own state. For example, initGrid() is specific to initializing a simulation grid
// with discrete cells, createCell() is specific to creating a cell with a given state and location, and the 
// toBeUpdatedList functions to identify cells that have changed state this step and must be updated by the view.

// Additionally, this classâ€™s member variables are all private. The setters in this class check for updates to the data 
// that could be harmful, such as null objects, and the data is accessed by getters. Any constants are loaded via a 
// properties file (i.e. myDefaultState, which specifies the default state for a new cell in any simulation, and 
// myCellRow and myCellCol which specify the location of the cell of interest within a 3x3 grid of its neighborhood). 
// The properties file allows changes to these constants to be made easily and in an obvious place (e.g. changing the
// default state for the Fire simulation from TREE to EMPTY would simply require changing the value in the 
// Rules.properties file).
